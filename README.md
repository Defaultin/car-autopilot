# Project Description

This project presents methods for training Autonomous Driving Models using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies and Deep Learning and theirs implementation in 2D and 3D simulations.

## [Self-driving 2D](https://github.com/Defaultin/car-autopilot/tree/master/self-driving-ai-2d)

Training an autopilot model using genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks on randomly generated highways in a 2D simulation.

## [Self-parking 2D](https://github.com/Defaultin/car-autopilot/tree/master/self-parking-ai-2d)

Training an autopilot model using genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks on randomly generated parking lot in a 2D simulation.
