# Project Description

This project presents methods for training Autonomous Driving Models using NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies and Deep Learning and their implementation in 2D and 3D simulations.

## [#1](https://github.com/Defaultin/car-autopilot/tree/master/self-driving-ai-2d) - Self-driving 2D

Training an autopilot model using genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks on randomly generated highways in a 2D simulation.

## [#2](https://github.com/Defaultin/car-autopilot/tree/master/self-parking-ai-2d) - Self-parking 2D

Training an autopilot model using genetic algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks on randomly generated parking lot in a 2D simulation.

## [#3](https://github.com/Defaultin/car-autopilot/tree/master/behavioral-cloning-3d) - Self-driving 3D

Training an autopilot deep learning model based on behavioral cloning metodology using Udacity's self driving car 3D [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
